#The concept is to use decimal expansion theory (ref: mathworld.wolfram.com/DecimalExpansion.html)
#stating that when a rational number m/n with (m,n)=1 is expanded, the period (repetitive decimal)
#begins after s terms and has length  t, where s and t are the smallest numbers satisfying
#                            10^s=10^(s+t) (mod n).
#When nâ‰¢0 (mod 2, 5), s=0, and this becomes a purely periodic decimal with
#                            10^t=1 (mod n).
#In the code I change the variable a liitle by making s = s+t. Also I use bucket theory to save possible 's' value because
# the idea is just to find what is the positive minimum t and s that 10^t (mod n) gives
# the same remainder as 10^(s+t) mod(n) where n = divider(input).
#After I implement this theory into the code(line 18-32). I will know exactly from when is the decimal be repetitive and how long.
#After that, I use this information as the define condition in  the common long divition method under the length t.
#Noted that when the decimal is finite, t-s will be equal to one and the next quotient
# of the calculation is 0 (finite deciamal is when 0 is repetitive at the end of the number)
#In addition to that, I also need to add the condition for when will I add '(' and ')' (further explantion along the code)
